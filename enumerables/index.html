            <p>So everyone was right last week in saying that this was just the beginning. The knowledge we were given this week to learn was great because with learning enumerables I found it interesting but also very difficult to try to memorize all the enumerables to use to be able to complete the exercises the right way. I realized this week there will be a lot of searching on both the Ruby docs and Google. I'm so thankful for the teachers to be there for help, not only during class time but before school, lunch and after school. Someone told me that Ruby is a great language to be in not only because Ruby developers are in demand but also that the Ruby community very collaborative. While this week was good it was also quite stressful because it was also Denver Startup Week which had events almost every night. I tried to go to as many as possible with my classmates and while I was there I was reassured exactly why this was the right decision for me.</p>
