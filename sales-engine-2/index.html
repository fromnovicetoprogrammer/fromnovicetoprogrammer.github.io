            <p>This was the final week of my first module and I past my first assessment (WooHoo!) It has been a crazy six weeks and I have learned so much but I know that the future has so much more knowledge for me to learn and I cannot wait. This week we conquered the business intelligence part of sales engine and boy, it was something I wasn't expecting. There was so much data to work with that included having to pull parts from multiple databases and respond with properly formatted data. My partner in sales engine did not pass her assessment and so I had to work on the project by myself while she studied for the retest. It was definitely the hardest thing I have done yet but the knowledge I acquired doing it myself was insurmountable. I'm really looking forward to a week away from school to recuperate and study to be ahead of the game. To be honest, I really cannot wait until I get to dive in to the next module because I hear it is all about the web side of development with Sinatra and Rail. </p>
